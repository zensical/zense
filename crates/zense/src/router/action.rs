/// Action.
///
/// If a route is matched, the registered action is called with the [`Request`]
/// and [`Params`], which were extracted from the route, if any. Currently, an
/// action is required to always return a [`Response`], which means it will be
/// considered the end of the processing chain.
///
/// Of course it's possible to add middlewares after routes, but it's important
/// to understand that they are only executed if none of the routes matched.
pub trait Action: 'static {
    /// Handles the given request with parameters.
    ///
    /// This method is invoked with a request and parameters and is required to
    /// return a response. It must be infallible and should not panic. Note that
    /// actions are rather an internal concept, which are automatically created
    /// when registering routes in a [`Router`].
    ///
    /// # Examples
    ///
    /// This example shows how to implement a teapot route responding with
    /// "418 I'm a Teapot" status code when the client tries to `GET /coffee`,
    /// while answering all other requests with "404 Not Found". This example
    /// uses a [`Router`], the idiomatic method to implement routing.
    ///
    /// [`Router`]: crate::router::Router
    ///
    /// ```

    /// // Create router and add route

    ///     .get("/coffee", |req: Request, params: Params| {
